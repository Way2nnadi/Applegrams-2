Light blue pieces sit within a legal, row-wise, scrabble word.
Light orange pieces within a legal, column-wise, scrabble word.
If the piece is purplish-red, it is both.

NOTE: Pieces with no adjacent pieces row-wise will also be light blue, as the same situation
column-wise will make the piece light orange. This makes sense when you think about it. Once 
all pieces are a mix of these two colors, all words on the board are valid, and another piece will be added.
