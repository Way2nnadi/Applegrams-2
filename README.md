There is a lot of work to be done. I'll accept anything that improves it, even something as small as changing a variable name.

Light blue pieces sit within a legal, row-wise, scrabble word.
Light orange pieces within a legal, column-wise, scrabble word.
If the piece is purplish-red, it is both.

NOTE: Pieces with no adjacent pieces row-wise will also be light blue, as the same situation
column-wise will make the piece light orange. This makes sense when you think about it. Once all pieces are a mix of these two colors (purplish-red?), all words on the board are valid, and the player will be notified.
